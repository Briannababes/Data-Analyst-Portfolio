#  Brihanna Nwakor – Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!  
I am an enthusiastic Computer Science graduate with a focused passion for **data analysis, data-driven application development, and creative problem-solving**. I bring hands-on experience working with real datasets, where I’ve applied **data cleansing, modeling, visualization, and interpretation** using tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
I have contributed to various data-driven solutions both individually and collaboratively—transforming raw data into actionable insights and building functional applications that drive real results.
